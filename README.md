This is my github learning tutorial
hii
<h1> to configure git </h1>
<hr>
1. git config --global user.name "username" <br>
2. git config --global user.email "userEmail"
<br>
3. git config --list


<h1> to clone the repository or get status of the file</h1>
1. git clone "repository link" <br>
2. git status

<h1> add / commit files</h1>
1. git add "filename"       --> to add single file (without adding files we cannot commit) <br>
2. git add .                --> to add all files at a time
<br>
3. git commit -m "add a comment"

<h1> init commands </h1>
<hr>
1.git init
<br>
2. git add remote <..link>
<br>
3. git remote -v (verify remote)
<br>
4. git branch (to get branch name)
<br>
5. git branch -M main (to rename branch )
<br>
6. git push orgin main 
<br>
7. git push -u (to push all upstream files)
<h1> branch commands </h1>
1. git branch (to get branch name)
<br>
2. git branch -M main (to rename branch )
<br>
3. git checkout -b <..branchName> (to create a branch)
<br>
4.  git checkout branchName  (to navigate branches)
<br>
5.  git checkout -d <..branchName> (to delete branch. here we cannot delete current branch if we have to delete the branch we have to navigate to another branch and delete that particular branch)

#Merging Code
<h1>2 ways <h1>
<br>
<h1>1st way <h1>
<hr>
1. git diff <--branchName--> (to compare commits , branches, files & more)
<br>
2 . git merge <--branchName--> ( to merge 2 branches)

<h2>2nd Way <h2>
by using pull request on github

pull request: it tells about changes you have pushed to a branch on repository on github


<h1>Undoing Changes <h1>

Case 1: staged changes

git reset <- file name ->
<br>
git reset
<br>
Case 2: commited changes (for one commit)
<br>

git reset HEAD~1
<br>

Case 3: commited changes (for many commits)
<br>

git reset <- commit hash ->
<br>

git reset --hard <- commit hash
<br>



<h1>Fork</h1>

a fork refers to a personal copy of another userâ€™s repository. When you fork a repository, a new copy of the repository is created under your own account enabling you to experiment and edit as necessary
